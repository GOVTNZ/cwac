# Place URLs in CSV files within /base_urls/nocrawl/
# and CWAC will crawl those specified web pages.

# nocrawl_mode must be enabled in the config for URLs
# specified in this folder to be loaded - it turns off
# crawling functions, and instead only visits specified
# URLs.

# However, you must ensure there is a CSV in the /base_urls/crawl/
# directory that associates the URL with an 'organisation' and 'sector'
# so that information is populated when using nocrawl mode.

# You can place multiple CSV files into the /base_urls/nocrawl/ folder
# and they will all be loaded.

# Below is an example of the expected format of CSV files:

url
https://www.put-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
https://www.put-another-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
https://www.put-yet-another-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
