# Place URLs in CSV files within /base_urls/nohead/
# and the CWAC will avoid making HEAD requests to
# those websites if they are listed in /base_urls/visit/

# You can place multiple CSV files into the /base_urls/nohead/ folder
# and they will all be loaded.

# Below is an example of the expected format of CSV files:

url
https://www.put-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
https://www.put-another-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
https://www.put-yet-another-target-domain-name-here.govt.nz/
